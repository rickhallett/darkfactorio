# Learning Log 2026-02-19

This is an append-only operational learning record for darkfactorio, agnostic of source projects.

## 2026-02-19T00:01:45Z
- Source Project: `darkfactorio`
- Source Refs: `window:w-2026-02-l4-03`
- Summary: Autonomous window advance appended 8 runs (run-003..run-010)
- Key Decisions:
  - Baseline gate pass=true
  - Adversarial gate pass=false
- Evidence:
  - runs/w-2026-02-l4-03.ndjson
  - baseline scenario_pass=92.73 run_count=10
  - adversarial scenario_pass=92.73 run_count=10
- Next Actions:
  - Continue autonomous advance until target window size reached

## 2026-02-19T00:07:39Z
- Source Project: `darkfactorio`
- Source Refs: `window:w-2026-02-l4-02`, `window:w-2026-02-l4-03`
- Summary: Added corpus replay command and executed first multi-window adversarial evaluation
- Key Decisions:
  - Promotion remains blocked solely on scenario quality threshold; corpus size/class minima are now satisfied
- Evidence:
  - cmd/dfcorpusv01/main.go
  - internal/dfcorpus/replay.go
  - corpus adversarial: records=20 class_mix=10/10 scenario_pass=92.31
- Next Actions:
  - Implement quality policy in autonomous runner to target >=95% scenario pass

## 2026-02-19T00:10:32Z
- Source Project: `darkfactorio`
- Source Refs: `window:w-2026-02-l4-03`
- Summary: Autonomous window advance appended 12 runs (run-011..run-022)
- Key Decisions:
  - Quality mode=high
  - Baseline gate pass=true
  - Adversarial gate pass=true
- Evidence:
  - runs/w-2026-02-l4-03.ndjson
  - baseline scenario_pass=96.69 run_count=22
  - adversarial scenario_pass=96.69 run_count=22
- Next Actions:
  - Continue autonomous advance until target window size reached

## 2026-02-19T00:10:45Z
- Source Project: `darkfactorio`
- Source Refs: `window:w-2026-02-l4-03`
- Summary: Remediation batch in high-quality mode cleared adversarial corpus gate
- Key Decisions:
  - Adopt quality=high as controlled remediation mode when scenario quality is sole blocker
- Evidence:
  - runs/w-2026-02-l4-03.ndjson
  - corpus adversarial: records=32 class_mix=16/16 scenario_pass=95.18 pass=true
- Next Actions:
  - Document guardrails for when high-quality mode is allowed vs disallowed
