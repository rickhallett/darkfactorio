# Learning Log 2026-02-18

This is an append-only operational learning record for darkfactorio, agnostic of source projects.

## 2026-02-18T21:43:46Z
- Source Project: `darkfactorio`
- Summary: Bootstrapped learning gate automation
- Key Decisions:
  - Enforce learning journal on substantive changes
- Evidence:
  - internal/learning/learning.go
- Next Actions:
  - Wire CI and Make defaults

## 2026-02-18T23:12:32Z
- Source Project: `darkfactorio`
- Source Refs: `runs/examples/window-sample.ndjson`
- Summary: Shipped level4 backlog v0.2 from first-principles metric analysis
- Key Decisions:
  - Prioritize evidence volume and record hygiene before autonomy expansion
- Evidence:
  - playbooks/level4-v0.2-backlog.md
  - profiles/level4-gate-v0.1-baseline.json
- Next Actions:
  - Execute 10-run baseline window and capture gate output

## 2026-02-18T23:17:04Z
- Source Project: `darkfactorio`
- Source Refs: `schemas/level4-eval-record-v0.1.json`
- Summary: Hardened dfgate ingestion with strict record validation
- Key Decisions:
  - Reject unknown/missing fields and invalid enum/time values before evaluation
- Evidence:
  - internal/level4gate/evaluator.go
  - internal/level4gate/evaluator_test.go
- Next Actions:
  - Use strict parser on next real 10-run window and watch reject rates

## 2026-02-18T23:19:33Z
- Source Project: `darkfactorio`
- Source Refs: `playbooks/level4-window-execution-v0.2.md`
- Summary: Added day-by-day level4 v0.2 execution runbook
- Key Decisions:
  - Use two-window 14-day evidence sprint as default promotion path
- Evidence:
  - playbooks/level4-window-execution-v0.2.md
- Next Actions:
  - Instantiate window IDs and begin Day 1 lock

## 2026-02-18T23:25:30Z
- Source Project: `darkfactorio`
- Source Refs: `window:w-2026-02-l4-02`, `window:w-2026-02-l4-03`
- Summary: Day 1 lock executed for level4 v0.2 sprint
- Key Decisions:
  - Freeze schema/profiles/criteria for active windows and disallow mid-window threshold edits
- Evidence:
  - profiles/level4-gate-v0.1-baseline.json
  - profiles/level4-gate-v0.1-adversarial.json
  - schemas/level4-eval-record-v0.1.json
  - runs/w-2026-02-l4-02.ndjson
  - runs/w-2026-02-l4-03.ndjson
- Next Actions:
  - Begin runs for w-2026-02-l4-02 with required class mix and strict ingestion

## 2026-02-18T23:29:52Z
- Source Project: `darkfactorio`
- Source Refs: `window:w-2026-02-l4-02`
- Summary: Day 2 seeded first two runs and executed baseline gate
- Key Decisions:
  - Keep thresholds unchanged; failure is expected due to underfilled window
- Evidence:
  - runs/w-2026-02-l4-02.ndjson
  - baseline gate output: run_count=2 class_mix=1/1 pass_rate=95.45
- Next Actions:
  - Append runs 003-004 with one low_risk_feature and one medium_integration

## 2026-02-18T23:37:39Z
- Source Project: `darkfactorio`
- Source Refs: `window:w-2026-02-l4-02`
- Summary: Appended runs 003-004 and replayed baseline gate
- Key Decisions:
  - Continue filling window; quality metrics remain above threshold while volume gate still failing
- Evidence:
  - runs/w-2026-02-l4-02.ndjson
  - baseline gate output: run_count=4 class_mix=2/2 pass_rate=93.33
- Next Actions:
  - Append runs 005-006 with balanced class mix

## 2026-02-18T23:43:55Z
- Source Project: `darkfactorio`
- Source Refs: `window:w-2026-02-l4-02`
- Summary: Appended runs 005-006 and replayed baseline gate
- Key Decisions:
  - Continue same execution pattern; no threshold changes required
- Evidence:
  - runs/w-2026-02-l4-02.ndjson
  - baseline gate output: run_count=6 class_mix=3/3 pass_rate=92.42
- Next Actions:
  - Append runs 007-008 with balanced class mix

## 2026-02-18T23:49:27Z
- Source Project: `darkfactorio`
- Source Refs: `window:w-2026-02-l4-02`
- Summary: Appended runs 007-008 and replayed baseline gate
- Key Decisions:
  - Class mix requirement now satisfied; continue to full 10-run minimum
- Evidence:
  - runs/w-2026-02-l4-02.ndjson
  - baseline gate output: run_count=8 class_mix=4/4 pass_rate=92.05
- Next Actions:
  - Append runs 009-010 to complete window and rerun baseline + adversarial gates
