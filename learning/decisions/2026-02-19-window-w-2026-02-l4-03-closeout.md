# Window Closeout: w-2026-02-l4-03

## Context

This is the second full 10-run window in the v0.2 execution cycle, completed via the autonomous runner.

## Decision

- Baseline gate: pass.
- Adversarial replay: fail.
- Promotion: not eligible; adversarial envelope still unmet.

## Metrics Snapshot

- Run count: 10
- Class mix: low_risk_feature=5, medium_integration=5
- Scenario pass rate: 92.73%
- First-pass rate: 100%
- Mean retries: 1.00
- Decision reversal rate: 0%
- Approved critical incidents: 0

## Top 3 Blockers

1. Adversarial minimum run count unmet per single-window replay (`10 < 20`).
2. Adversarial class minimum unmet per single-window replay (`5 < 8` for each class).
3. Adversarial scenario threshold unmet (`92.73 < 95.00`).

## Corrective Actions

1. Add a corpus replay mode that evaluates multiple windows together against adversarial profile.
2. Raise scenario quality target to >=95% for next window by reducing 1-failure defaults in generated/selected runs.
3. Keep autonomous runner, but pin explicit quality target in command-time policy.

## Next Review

- Trigger: corpus-level adversarial replay implementation + first combined replay run
- Date: immediate on implementation
