# Window Closeout: w-2026-02-l4-02

## Context

This is the first full 10-run window under the `level4-window-execution-v0.2` process.

## Decision

- Baseline gate: pass.
- Adversarial replay: fail.
- Promotion: not eligible; continue into next window.

## Metrics Snapshot

- Run count: 10
- Class mix: low_risk_feature=5, medium_integration=5
- Scenario pass rate: 91.89%
- First-pass rate: 100%
- Mean retries: 1.00
- Decision reversal rate: 0%
- Approved critical incidents: 0

## Top 3 Blockers

1. Adversarial minimum run count unmet (`10 < 20`).
2. Adversarial class minimum unmet (`5 < 8` for each class).
3. Adversarial scenario threshold unmet (`91.89 < 95.00`).

## Corrective Actions

1. Build second full window (`w-2026-02-l4-03`) with at least 10 additional runs.
2. Maintain balanced class distribution from run 1 to avoid end-window corrections.
3. Raise scenario pass quality target from 92% band toward >=95% by tightening scenario prep before execution.

## Next Review

- Trigger: completion of `w-2026-02-l4-03`
- Date: immediate upon window close
