# Legacy Migration Roadmap: <system>

## System Assessment
- Business criticality:
- Architecture summary:
- Test/documentation reality:
- Tribal knowledge concentration:
- Specification debt estimate (% behavior undocumented):

## Phase 1: Specification Extraction
- Extraction method:
- Priority areas:
- AI-assisted tasks:
- Human-only tasks:
- Decision-why capture method:
- Holdout scenario suite build plan:
- Effort/timeline:
- Knowledge externalization plan:

## Phase 2: Testing Strategy Redesign
- Shift to scenario-based evaluation:
- Digital twin design:
- Behavioral coverage strategy:
- CI/CD changes for AI-generated code:

## Phase 3: Parallel Development Tracks
- Legacy track (Level 2/3):
- New component track (Level 4/5 patterns):
- Boundary/integration contract:
- Integration risk controls:

## Phase 4: Progressive Handoff
- Handoff criteria per component:
- Readiness signals for autonomy:
- Components likely to stay Level 3/4:
- Why that is acceptable:

## Institutional Knowledge Risk Assessment
| Area | Knowledge Owners | Bus Factor | Attrition Risk | Externalization Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <domain> | <people> | <n> | low/med/high | P0/P1/P2 |

## Honest Timeline
- Phase 1:
- Phase 2:
- Phase 3:
- Phase 4:
- First expected productivity return:
- Total timeline:
